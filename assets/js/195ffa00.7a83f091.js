How can\nwe connect the outcome of funded projects to the token value? A more reasonable mechanism would be based on the NEO\ntoken instead of a new token.

NEO\nowners should be inventiviced to vote on those proposal that bring most value to the ecosystem thereby promising an\nincrease of the NEO price. The problem with that approach is its complexity. Snapshots of NEO balances at certain points\nin time have to be stored in the DAOs contracts in order to prevent "double-voting attacks". In the end, we decided to\nstart out with a simpler model.
