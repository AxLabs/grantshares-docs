## Proposal Types

The GrantShares contracts allow for any on-chain actions to be included in a proposal. But, there is a set of most
prominent proposal types that are available in the GrantShares app. 

- **Request for Funding**: This is the most essential proposal type and used by someone who's looking for a grant. It
consists of a token, token amount and receiver address. 

- **Add Member**: The members of the GrantShares DAO can be modified. This proposl type adds a new member that can take
part in votes from then on.

- **Remove Member**: Removes a member.

- **Set Parameter**: Sets the value of a parameter on the governance contract.

used to calculate the token amount)
