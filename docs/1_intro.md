# Introduction
 
GrantShares is a grants program governed by the GrantShares DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), with the goal
of fostering independent projects in the Neo ecosystem. The funding will be primarily provided by the Neo Foundation.
The program is an extension of already existing Neo Eco Support.

The GrantShares DAO is composed and governed by the GrantShares *Council Members* - also simply called *Members* - which
are initially chosen by the Neo Foundation. The initial members are a small group of individuals/entities well known for
their contributions in the Neo ecosystem and with an incentive to increase Neoâ€™s impact and reach through community 
activities. GrantShares members analyze and discuss project proposals submitted to the GrantShares dApp and vote on
them. Discussions and voting happen in public, meaning, that anyone can take part in the discussion but voting is
restricted to the members. We are looking into designs that distributed the decision power to a broader audience 
(e.g., all NEO hodlers) in the future but is initially restricted to the GrantShares members.

The implementation and maintenance of the project is provided by [AxLabs](https://axlabs.com) with support from
[NNT](https://neonewstoday.com/), [Red4Sec](https://red4sec.com/), [CoZ](https://coz.io/), and other sponsored
Neo community members.
