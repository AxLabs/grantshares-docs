# Introduction
 
GrantShares is a community-driven grants program governed by the GrantShares DAO (Decentralized Autonomous
Organization), with the goal of fostering independent projects in the Neo ecosystem. The program is an extension of the
already existing [Neo Eco Support](https://neo.org/eco) and funding is primarily provided by the Neo Foundation.  

The GrantShares DAO is composed and governed by the GrantShares *Council Members* - also simply called *Members* - which
are initially chosen by the Neo Foundation. The initial members are a small group of individuals/entities well known for
their long-term contributions in the Neo ecosystem and with an incentive to increase Neoâ€™s impact and reach through
community activities. GrantShares members have voting power on proposals submitted to the GrantShares DAO. This happens
in public. The analysis and discussions of proposals is open to anyone. 

The technical implementation and maintenance of the project is performed by [AxLabs](https://axlabs.com) with support from
[NNT](https://neonewstoday.com/), [Red4Sec](https://red4sec.com/), [CoZ](https://coz.io/), and other sponsored
Neo community members.
