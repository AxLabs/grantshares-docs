# Introduction
 
GrantShares is a grants program governed by the GrantShares DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), with the goal
of fostering independent projects in the Neo ecosystem. The funding will be primarily provided by the Neo Foundation.
The program is an extension of already existing Neo Eco Support.

The GrantShares DAO is composed and governed by the GrantShares *Council Members* - also simply called *Members* - which
are initially chosen by the Neo Foundation. The initial members are a small group of individuals/entities well known for
their contributions in the Neo ecosystem and with an incentive to increase Neoâ€™s impact and reach through community 
activities. GrantShares members analyze and discuss project proposals submitted to the GrantShares dApp and vote on
them. Discussions and voting happen in public, meaning, that anyone can take part in the discussion. We are investigating the feasibility to employ designs that could distribute the decision power to a broader audience in the future (e.g., NEO hodlers), but currently voting power is restricted to the GrantShares DAO members.

The technical implementation and maintenance of the project is performed by [AxLabs](https://axlabs.com) with support from
[NNT](https://neonewstoday.com/), [Red4Sec](https://red4sec.com/), [CoZ](https://coz.io/), and other sponsored
Neo community members.
