## Description

‚úàÔ∏è **Get to Centre Point with a Travel Grant!** 

To support active builders in the Neo ecosystem, [GrantShares DAO](https://grantshares.io) is offering travel grants of up to $2,000 USD for **individuals** who need financial assistance to attend [CentrePoint Meetup #2 in Singapore](https://medium.com/centrepoint/centre-point-meetup-2-singapore-september-27-29-548320dfa77a), Sep 27-29, 2025.

## Why attend?

- üöÄ **Network & Collaborate** - Engage with top minds in the Neo ecosystem, strengthen partnerships, and contribute to meaningful discussions.
- üí° **Showcase your work** - Share progress, insights, and challenges with the broader community to drive Neo adoption and innovation.
- üìà **Shape the future of Neo** - Participate in technical discussions, ecosystem proposals, and roadmap planning to help define the next phase of Neo‚Äôs growth.

## Who Can Apply?

To be eligible for a Centre Point travel grant, applicants must:

- Be actively building, maintaining, or contributing to something in the Neo ecosystem.
- Not be part of a sponsored community (i.e., directly funded by NGD or the Neo Council).
- Not be a member of a Neo Council team.

Grants will be limited, and proposals will follow the standard GrantShares endorsement and voting process.

:::note
*These grants are designed for grassroots builders and contibutors in the Neo ecosystem who don't already have financial support that would enable travel.*

## What the Grant Covers

- Flight and accommodation only ‚Äî other expenses (e.g., meals, taxis, visas) **are not in the scope of the grant**. You are expected to stay at the [Carlton Hotel](https://www.carltonhotel.sg) as we have set rates for accommodation. You may opt to stay elsewhere, but we kindly ask that you only do so if you find a more cost-effective option.
- Grants are available up to $2,000 USD, based on your **actual** travel costs. Overestimation of flights and accommodation will not be tolerated.
- You **must** provide a (detailed) quote or breakdown of your expected expenses when applying, e.g., including flight numbers, from/to cities, screenshots, and other details for maximum transparency.
- Grants are intended to cover one person per team.

## How to Apply?

üö® **Pay attention to the following when creating your proposal:**

- Submit a proposal via the GrantShares dApp under the category "Request For Funding". 
- Include 'GS-003: Your Name/Nickname' in the title. Example: `GS-003: Alice NeoBuilder`.
- Explain your contributions to the Neo ecosystem and why attending Centre Point will benefit the community. 
- Outline estimated travel/accommodation costs (up to US $2,000). Be as explicit as possible regarding flights and accommodation.
- Pay attention that this RFP only supports non-luxurious, economy-class travel arrangements. Proposals with excessive or premium travel costs will be rejected.
- Provide a link to your project, website, or relevant social media so that the community can verify your work.

We look forward to welcoming dedicated Neo contributors to Centre Point and helping to build a stronger, more connected ecosystem.
