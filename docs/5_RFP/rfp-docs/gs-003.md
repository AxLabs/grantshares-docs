## Description

‚úàÔ∏è **Get to Centre Point with a Travel Grant!** 

To support active builders in the Neo ecosystem, [GrantShares DAO](https://grantshares.io) is offering travel grants of up to \$2,000 USD for **individuals** who need financial assistance to attend [CentrePoint Meetup #2 in Singapore](https://medium.com/centrepoint/centre-point-meetup-2-singapore-september-27-29-548320dfa77a), Sep 27-29, 2025.

## Why attend?

- üöÄ **Network & Collaborate** - Engage with top minds in the Neo ecosystem, strengthen partnerships, and contribute to meaningful discussions.
- üí° **Showcase your work** - Share progress, insights, and challenges with the broader community to drive Neo adoption and innovation.
- üìà **Shape the future of Neo** - Participate in technical discussions, ecosystem proposals, and roadmap planning to help define the next phase of Neo‚Äôs growth.

## Who Can Apply?

To be eligible for a Centre Point travel grant, applicants must:

- Be actively building, maintaining, or contributing to something in the Neo ecosystem.
- Not be part of a sponsored community (i.e., directly funded by NGD or the Neo Council).
- Not be a member of a Neo Council team.

Grants will be limited, and proposals will follow the standard GrantShares endorsement and voting process.

:::note
*These grants are designed for grassroots builders and contributors in the Neo ecosystem who don't already have financial support that would enable travel.*

## What the Grant Covers

- The grant covers **flight and accommodation only**. Other expenses (such as meals, taxis, visas, etc.) **are not included**.
- You are expected to stay at the [Carlton Hotel](https://www.carltonhotel.sg), where we have secured special rates. If you choose another hotel, please do so only if it is more cost-effective.
- You may request up to **4 nights of accommodation**. At the Carlton Hotel's special rate ([details here](https://medium.com/centrepoint/centre-point-2-update-venue-confirmed-and-travel-grants-now-open-5f4484832764)), each night is approximately USD \$205 (totaling USD \$820 for 4 nights).
- Grants are available for up to **\$2,000 USD**, based on your **actual travel costs**. Do not overestimate your flight or accommodation expenses -- requests with inflated costs will be rejected.
- You **must** provide a detailed quote or breakdown of your expected expenses, including flight numbers, departure/arrival cities, screenshots, and any other relevant details for transparency.
- Grants are intended for **one person per team**.
- The grant **does not cover Token2049** (conference tickets or related events). This travel grant is **exclusively for Centre Point**.

## How to Apply?

üö® **Pay attention to the following when creating your proposal:**

- Submit a proposal via the GrantShares dApp under the category "Request For Funding". 
- Include 'GS-003: Your Name/Nickname' in the title. Example: `GS-003: Alice NeoBuilder`.
- Explain your contributions to the Neo ecosystem and why attending Centre Point will benefit the community. 
- Outline estimated travel/accommodation costs (up to USD \$2,000). Be as explicit as possible regarding flights and accommodation.
- Pay attention that this RFP only supports non-luxurious, economy-class travel arrangements. Proposals with excessive or premium travel costs will be rejected.
- Provide a link to your project, website, or relevant social media so that the community can verify your work.

We look forward to welcoming dedicated Neo contributors to Centre Point and helping to build a stronger, more connected ecosystem.
